# PluginRadar Website Rebrand — Strategy & Copy Plan

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Objective:** Pivot from "find plugin deals" → "build, share & discover plugin chains"

---

## 1. Competitive Analysis

### Direct Competitors (Plugin Chain Sharing)

| Product | What It Does | Limitation | Our Edge |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Waves StudioVerse** | Chain presets using Waves plugins only | **Locked to Waves ecosystem** — useless if you use FabFilter, Soundtoys, etc. | We work with ANY VST3/AU/AAX plugin |
| **Kilohearts Snap Heap / Multipass** | Modular chain builder with snapins | **Only Kilohearts' own plugins** — no 3rd party support | We host ANY plugin from ANY manufacturer |
| **KSHMR Chain** | Copy chains across tracks | **Utility tool, not a sharing platform** — no community, no presets | We have cloud sharing + community |
| **Kushview Element** | Open-source plugin host | **Developer tool** — no UI, no community, no presets | Beautiful UI + social features |
| **DAW channel strips** | Built-in chains in each DAW | **Not portable** — Logic chains don't work in Pro Tools | We're cross-DAW by design |

### Key Insight
**Nobody is doing what we do.** The closest competitor (Waves StudioVerse) is locked to their own plugin ecosystem. There is NO platform where you can:
1. Build chains from ANY plugins you own
2. Share them with a community
3. Load them cross-DAW
4. See per-plugin metering inline
5. Do advanced parallel/serial routing

This is our blue ocean. The "deal tracking" angle puts us in a crowded space (Plugin Boutique, ADSR, KVR, etc.). The chain sharing angle puts us in a category of ONE.

---

## 2. Positioning Statement

### Old Positioning
> "Track prices across 900+ plugins. Get alerts when prices drop, discover free tools, and build your perfect collection."

**Problem:** Generic. Plugin Boutique, ADSR, and KVR all do this. We're a small fish in a big pond.

### New Positioning
> "Build plugin chains with any VST/AU/AAX plugins. Share them with friends. Load them in any DAW."

**Framework (PAS):**
- **Problem:** Your best mixing chains are trapped in your DAW sessions. You can't easily share a vocal chain with a friend on a different DAW, learn from other engineers' setups, or reuse your go-to chains across projects.
- **Agitation:** Every time you collaborate, you screenshot your plugin list. "I used Pro-Q 3 into LA-2A into a Valhalla plate." The other person manually recreates it. Settings get lost. Gain staging is wrong. The magic disappears.
- **Solution:** PluginRadar is the first plugin chain platform that works with ANY plugins. Build your chain with visual routing. Share it with a link. Your friend loads it — with automatic compatibility matching for their plugins. Cross-DAW. Cross-platform. One click.

---

## 3. Core Value Props (Priority Order)

### 🔗 VP1: "Any Plugin, Any Chain" (Primary)
Build chains using plugins from ANY manufacturer — not locked to one ecosystem like StudioVerse.

**Why it wins:** 95% of engineers use plugins from 5+ different manufacturers. No existing chain tool supports that.

### 🌍 VP2: "Cross-DAW Portability" (Secondary)
Your chain presets work in Logic, Pro Tools, Ableton, FL Studio, Studio One, Reaper — any DAW.

**Why it wins:** Collaboration between DAWs is the #1 pain point in music production. Studios, bands, and remote collaborators all use different DAWs.

### 👥 VP3: "Share & Discover" (Social Proof)
Share your chains with friends via link. Browse chains from the community. Fork and customize.

**Why it wins:** Producers learn by studying other people's setups. Reddit's r/mixingmastering is full of "share your mix bus chain" threads. We formalize this.

### 📊 VP4: "See Your Signal Flow" (Technical Differentiator)
Visual serial/parallel routing with per-plugin inline metering. No DAW shows you gain staging across an entire chain.

**Why it wins:** Pros obsess over gain staging. Seeing per-plugin levels is a feature that doesn't exist ANYWHERE else — not in any DAW, not in any plugin.

### 🔀 VP5: "Advanced Routing Made Simple" (Power Feature)
Parallel processing, serial groups, branch gain/pan, latency compensation — all visual, all drag-and-drop.

**Why it wins:** Setting up parallel compression in most DAWs requires aux sends, bus routing, and a PhD in signal flow. We make it drag-and-drop.

---

## 4. Target Audiences (Revised)

### Primary: The Collaborating Producer/Engineer
- Works with others across different DAWs
- Wants to share setups easily
- Ages 20-35, mid-level skill
- Pain: "I can't send my friend my vocal chain"

### Secondary: The Learning Mixer
- Watches YouTube mixing tutorials
- Wants to try pro engineers' chains
- Ages 18-28, beginner to intermediate
- Pain: "I want to use Andrew Scheps' vocal chain but I don't know the exact settings"

### Tertiary: The Organized Pro
- Has 100+ plugins, uses 20 regularly
- Builds go-to chains for every session
- Ages 25-45, advanced
- Pain: "I rebuild the same chain in every new session"

---

## 5. New Homepage Copy

### Hero Section

**H1:** `Build plugin chains. Share them with the world.`

**Subhead:** `The first platform that lets you build, share, and discover effect chains using any VST/AU/AAX plugin — across every DAW.`

**CTA Primary:** `Download Free` (desktop app)
**CTA Secondary:** `Browse Chains →`

**Stats Row (revised):**
| Stat | Label |
|------|-------|
| 743+ | Plugins Supported |
| Cross-DAW | Works Everywhere |
| Free | Open Community |
| Unlimited | Chains & Presets |

### Section 2: "How It Works" (3 Steps)

**Step 1: Build Your Chain**
> Drag any plugins from your collection into a visual chain editor. Set up serial or parallel routing with drag-and-drop. See per-plugin metering in real-time.

**Step 2: Share With Anyone**
> Save your chain to the cloud and share it with a link. Friends load it in their own DAW — with automatic plugin compatibility matching.

**Step 3: Discover & Learn**
> Browse chains shared by the community. Find vocal chains, drum bus setups, mastering chains. Fork them, tweak them, make them yours.

### Section 3: "What Makes Us Different" (Feature Grid)

| Feature | PluginRadar | Waves StudioVerse | Your DAW |
|---------|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| Works with ANY plugin | ✅ | ❌ Waves only | ✅ |
| Cross-DAW chains | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Community sharing | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Per-plugin metering | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Parallel/serial routing | ✅ | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Complex |
| Plugin compatibility check | ✅ | N/A | ❌ |
| Free to use | ✅ | Subscription | N/A |

### Section 4: "Built for Engineers Who Care About Signal Flow"

**Subhead:** `Advanced routing. Real-time metering. Zero hassle.`

Feature highlights with visuals:
1. **Per-Plugin Level Meters** — See exactly where your gain staging goes wrong
2. **Parallel Processing** — Split, process, merge — visually
3. **A/B/C Snapshots** — Compare three different chain configurations instantly
4. **LUFS Targeting** — Built-in loudness monitoring and matching
5. **Undo/Redo** — Experiment fearlessly with full history

### Section 5: "Join the Community" (Social Proof)

- "X chains shared this week"
- Featured chain of the week
- Top contributors
- Categories: Vocal Chains • Drum Bus • Mastering • Creative FX • Guitar

### Section 6: "Plugin Directory" (Demoted, Not Removed)

**Subhead:** `Browse 743+ plugins from 44+ manufacturers`

> Not sure which plugins to use in your chain? Browse our catalog with detailed specs, comparisons, and community ratings. Track prices and find deals.

**CTA:** `Explore Plugins →`

This keeps the old value prop alive but positions it as SUPPORTING the chain-building mission, not the main event.

## 6. Navigation Restructure

### Current Nav
`Plugins | Sales | Free | Chains | Brands | ♡ | 👤`

### Proposed Nav
`Chains | Explore | Community | Plugins | Download`

| Item | What It Contains |
|------|-----------------|
| **Chains** | Browse chains, featured, categories (replaces old homepage sections) |
| **Explore** | Trending chains, new this week, top creators |
| **Community** | Your friends, shared chains, activity feed |
| **Plugins** | Plugin directory, sales, free, manufacturers (combined) |
| **Download** | Desktop app download page (prominent CTA) |

### Why This Order
The first thing you see should be chains (the product), not plugins (the catalog). The download CTA is always visible because the desktop app is required to actually USE chains.

---

## 7. SEO Strategy Pivot

### Old Keywords (Crowded)
- "audio plugin deals" — competing with Plugin Boutique, ADSR, KVR
- "free VST plugins" — extremely competitive, low conversion
- "plugin price tracker" — small niche

### New Keywords (Blue Ocean)
| Keyword | Volume Est. | Competition | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| "plugin chain presets" | Low-Med | Very Low | 🎯 Own this |
| "vocal chain preset" | Medium | Low | 🎯 Category page |
| "mix bus chain" | Medium | Low | 🎯 Category page |
| "cross DAW collaboration plugin" | Low | Very Low | 🎯 Feature page |
| "share plugin chains" | Low | None | 🎯 We created this |
| "parallel processing plugin" | Medium | Low | Feature page |
| "plugin chain builder" | Low | None | 🎯 Homepage H1 |
| "mastering chain preset" | Medium | Low | Category page |
| "drum bus chain preset" | Low-Med | Low | Category page |

### Programmatic SEO Opportunity
Create pages for every chain category + plugin combination:
- `/chains/vocal` → "Best Vocal Plugin Chains"
- `/chains/mastering` → "Mastering Chain Presets"
- `/chains/drums` → "Drum Bus Chain Presets"
- `/chains/using/fabfilter-pro-q-3` → "Chains Using FabFilter Pro-Q 3"
- `/chains/using/waves-ssl-e-channel` → "Chains Using SSL E-Channel"

This creates hundreds of SEO-rich pages with real user content.

## 8. Metadata & Title Updates

### Current
```
title: "PluginRadar - Track Audio Plugin Deals"
description: "Never miss a sale on your favorite VST plugins. Track prices, get alerts, and discover new audio software."
```

### Proposed
```
title: "PluginRadar — Build & Share Plugin Chains Across Any DAW"
description: "Build effect chains with any VST/AU/AAX plugin. Share with friends cross-DAW. Discover vocal chains, mix bus setups, and mastering presets from the community."
```

---

## 9. Visual Identity Shift

### Current: Warm amber/gold theme = "deals, commerce, shopping"
### Proposed: Indigo/violet accent = "creative, professional, signal flow"

This aligns with the REDESIGN_VISION.md accent color migration (orange → indigo). The website should match the desktop app's new identity.

| Element | Current | Proposed |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Primary accent | Amber/gold (`#f59e0b`) | Indigo/violet (`#6366f1`) |
| Background | Warm dark (`#1a1714`) | Cool dark (`#0a0a0f`) |
| Feel | "Deal site" | "Pro creative tool" |
| Logo text | `PluginRadar` | `PluginRadar` (keep name, update color) |
| Tagline | "Track Audio Plugin Deals" | "Chain. Share. Create." |

---

## 10. Page-by-Page Update Plan

| Page | Current Purpose | New Purpose | Priority |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| `/` (Home) | Plugin deals hub | Chain discovery + download CTA | 🔴 P0 |
| `/chains` | Buried feature page | **Promoted to primary content** | 🔴 P0 |
| `/chains/[slug]` | Chain detail | Enhanced with visual preview, compatibility | 🟡 P1 |
| `/plugins` | Main catalog | Supporting content (discover plugins for chains) | 🟡 P1 |
| `/sales` | Deal listings | Kept but deprioritized in nav | 🟢 P2 |
| `/free` | Free plugins | Kept, reframed as "free plugins for your chains" | 🟢 P2 |
| `/manufacturers` | Brand listing | Kept, low priority | 🟢 P2 |
| `/community` | N/A (new) | Friends, activity, featured creators | 🟡 P1 |
| `/download` | N/A (new) | Desktop app download page | 🔴 P0 |

---

## 11. CTA Strategy

### Primary CTA: "Download Free"
The desktop app is the product. The website is the funnel. Every page should have a path to downloading the app.

### Secondary CTA: "Browse Chains"
For people not ready to download — let them see the value first.

### Tertiary CTA: "Share Your Chain"
For existing users — encourage contribution.

### CTA Placement
- **Hero:** Download + Browse side by side
- **Sticky header:** Small "Download" button (always visible)
- **After each chain card:** "Load this chain" → leads to download if no app
- **Footer:** Download CTA with platform icons (macOS, Windows)

## 12. Tagline Options

| # | Tagline | Framework | Feel |
|---|---------|-----------|------|
| 1 | **"Your plugins. Your chains. Shared everywhere."** | Ownership + Community | Empowering |
| 2 | **"Build chains. Break DAW walls."** | Problem → Solution | Bold |
| 3 | **"Chain. Share. Create."** | Action verbs | Clean/Apple-like |
| 4 | **"The plugin chain platform."** | Category claim | Authoritative |
| 5 | **"Where engineers share their signal flow."** | Community + Technical | Pro |
| 6 | **"Mix chains that travel."** | Portability | Clever |
| 7 | **"Plugin chains, unchained."** | Wordplay | Memorable |

**Recommendation:** #1 or #4 for the homepage. #3 for a logo tagline.
